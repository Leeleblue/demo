#Without Geolocalisation

Suppose : 

 * your navigator has no geolocalisation, 
 * you don't want to send your real geolocalisation,
 * there are no other users in your town, 
 * you want to test the demo with two browsers, with faking positions for your taxi an customer.

Then you can : 

 * click on the top right button,
 * drag your user where you want.
